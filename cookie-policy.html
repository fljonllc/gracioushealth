                    <p>
                        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you
                        visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites
                        work or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Gracious Health Services) are called "first
                        party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party
                        cookies". Third-party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or
                        through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set
                        these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
                        question and also when it visits certain other websites.

                    <p>
                        We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
                        technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential"
                        or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
                        of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
                        through our Websites for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in
                        more detail below.

                        purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served

                    <h4>How can I control cookies?</h4>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your
                        cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie
                        Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
                        Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
                        services.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If
                        you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some
                        functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your
                        web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse
                        cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit
                        your browser's help menu for more information.

                        In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt-out of targeted advertising. If

                    <p>
                        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other,
                        similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels"
                        or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to
                        recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This
                        allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a
                        website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
                        come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
                        improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In
                        many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so
                        declining cookies will impair their functioning.

                        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or
                        "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services,
                        fraud prevention, and other sites operations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of
                        your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website
                        Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage
                        Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for
                        example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to as "information" on the
                        Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without
                        your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not
                        being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).

                        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may

                        relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The
