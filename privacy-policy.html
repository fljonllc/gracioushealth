                        despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission

                        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify
                        your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the

                        You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your
                        behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof
                        that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the
                        CCPA.

                        feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request
                        submission.
